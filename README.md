## Overview

## My process

I began by analyzing the design and identifying which HTML tags would be most appropriate. Even for a single-component page, I strived to use the most relevant HTML possible. I then placed a border around the card to visualize it and adjusted its width as well as the width of the img element before applying the necessary inner padding, margins, and page colors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have learned to carefully analyze design requirements, use semantic HTML to create meaningful and accessible code, visualize layout with borders, adjust dimensions using CSS properties like width, and style components with padding, margins, and colors.


### Continued development

I found the process of design analysis to be enjoyable and challenging, and I want to continue to develop my skills in this area. The process of searching for the right CSS properties has helped me deepen my understanding of how to use flexbox effectively.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox cheatsheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to remember the different propreties of flexbox and align my content
- [ChatGpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - I used chatGpt to help me write this markdown using pretty words :)
